% introduction about the network stack?

\section{Overview}
The networking stack introduced in this thesis is implemented in the C\# 
programming language with SME. The aim of its design is to capacitate performance,
flexibility, and ease of use. In this chapter, the design principles are 
described, the architecture of the solution is outlined, and the components are
outlined.


\subsection{Design principles}
As briefly mentioned in the introduction, the proposed network stack is to 
provide an alternative to the existing proprietary network offloading engines.
While the main goal of this thesis is to research and study the suitability of 
SME for implementing a TCP/IP stack on an FPGA, there are many other aspects of the 
system to be studied.\\
% TODO 
% * support for various FPGAs
% * extensible network stack (not locked to few protocols)
% * firewall

\subsection{Initial requirements}
Following our design principles, initial requirements and goals for the 
networking stack are set so that these can be tested and improved upon. 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Essential protocols only}\\
Considering that the SME project is still fairly early in its development, and considering 
the sheer number of protocols in the internet protocol suite, the networking 
stack in this thesis is to support only the absolutely essential protocols 
required to provide the users with a meaningful interface to the internet.
These protocols should be picked such that the system can provide the end-user
with a network data-stream, which can transport information to and from a remote
computer.\\
The initial protocols chosen may be implemented and supported partially, but 
they must not deviate from the standard specifications. 

\item \textbf{Support an interface for the end-user}\\
The system must be controlled by an end-user on the FPGA. Such an interface is 
very unique in its own way, compared to standard software interfaces, like the 
ones defined in the POSIX collection of specifications. By supporting such an
external interface gains insight in the way such a networking stack will be used,
and which measures must be taken in order to provide the best possible integration
and performance considerations.

\item \textbf{Independent of underlying physical hardware}\\
By using SME, the underlying hardware description language code can be abstracted
away from the actual implementation. This will later provide developers to easily
modify and tweak the networking stack without having to consider the target 
hardware.\\
Likewise, the networking stack may not rely on using a certain physical layer hardware,
and must be designed to be independent of the underlying hardware used for the 
physical connections. This will ensure that the target hardware can easily 
swap between physical connectors, such as going from ethernet cables to wireless,
or even another FPGA.
