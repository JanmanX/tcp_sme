In this thesis, we design and implement a networking protocol using the
Synchronous Message Exchange model -- a new framework intended to help model
hardware descriptions.
The final pipelined design boasts with a decentralized memory model, with model
division easily extensible and modifiable, closely ressembling that of the
architecture of the Internet Protocol Suite.

Initial tests performed on the simulated system with real captured network
traffic suggests stability, promising protocol compliance, and an acceptable, but
theoretical, performance. Numerous suggestions are discussed to improve the performance,
such as widening the bus-widths or replicating the stack itself to multiply the
raw throughput.

Due to some trivial bugs and other minor missing features in the SME framework,
the system could not be brought to the target FPGA hardware. However, we are
optimistic that considerable performance is achieveable with the current design,
as well as great flexibility, extensibility and modularity of the system.
